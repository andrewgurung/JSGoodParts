Notes
-----
- Function stored in an object is called a method
- Refinement: .dot expression or [subscript] expression
- If an invocation expression contains a refinement, it is invoked as a method
- 'this' is bound to the object where method is stored
- 'this' is bound using late binding making it highly reusable
