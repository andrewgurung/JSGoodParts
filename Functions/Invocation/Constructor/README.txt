Notes
-----
- Functions that are intended to be used with 'new' are called Constructor
- Constructor are capitalized
- Invoking function with 'new' will create a new object with hidden link to
  the value of the function's prototype member
- 'this' will bound to the new object

Bad Practice
------------
- Use of constructor function is not recommended
